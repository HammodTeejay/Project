// The code you've posted is a simple Node.js script that creates an HTTP server. Here's what each part of the code does:

// const http = require('http');: This line imports the Node.js built-in 'http' module, which provides the functionality to create an HTTP server.

// const server = http.createServer((req, res) => { ... });: This code creates an HTTP server using the http.createServer method. It takes a callback function with two parameters, req and res. This function is called every time a request is made to the server.

// req: This parameter represents the request object, containing information about the incoming HTTP request, such as the URL, headers, and other request-related data.
// res: This parameter represents the response object, which is used to send a response to the client.
// res.end('Hello World\n');: Inside the request callback function, the code uses the res.end method to send the string 'Hello World' as the response to the client. The '\n' character is used to include a newline in the response.

// server.listen(4242, () => { ... });: This line tells the server to start listening on port 4242. The callback function is called once the server is successfully listening. Inside the callback function, 'Server is running...' is logged to the console.

// In summary, when you run this script, it creates a simple HTTP server that listens on port 4242. When a client makes a request to this server, it responds with 'Hello World\n'. You can access this response by visiting 'http://localhost:4242' in your web browser or by making a request to that URL programmatically using a tool like cURL or a library like Axios.
