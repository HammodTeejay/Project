setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Hello after 4 seconds");
}, 4 * 1000);

// The code you've posted uses the setTimeout function in JavaScript to schedule a callback function to execute after a specified delay. In this case, the callback function logs the message "Hello after 4 seconds" to the console after a 4-second delay.

// Here's a breakdown of the code:

// setTimeout(() => { ... }, 4 * 1000);: This line calls the setTimeout function with two arguments:

// The first argument is an anonymous arrow function, () => { console.log("Hello after 4 seconds"); }. This function will be executed after the specified delay.
// The second argument is 4 * 1000, which equals 4000 milliseconds (4 seconds). This is the delay before the function is executed.
// Inside the callback function, console.log("Hello after 4 seconds"); is used to log the message "Hello after 4 seconds" to the console.

// When you run this code, it will wait for 4 seconds and then print "Hello after 4 seconds" to the console. This demonstrates how setTimeout can be used to schedule code execution after a specific time interval.
